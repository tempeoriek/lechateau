          <p>Resistant like stone and transparent like <strong>crystal</strong> ,Cristalmood is a resin of Antoniolupi's own creation that is manually poured into molds. Once extracted, the objects must be finished manually by sanding them to remove all imperfections both inside and out. As if it were made of stone, each product is unique, the slight differences in color, size, it proceed to the sanding and polishing which are carried out manually in order to remove the imperfections and give brightness to the object. The final stage consists then in a protective fixative</p>
          <p>It is composed of high quality polyester resin and coloring pigments; has passed the anti-corrosion tests (salt spray) and can be cleaned with all the most common detergents. Thanks to the composition, objects made from Cristalmood weigh about 30% less than those made with solid surfaces</p>
          <p>The latest collaboration between Andrea Lupi and Gumdesign gives life to 3 new colors: <strong>CERULEO</strong>, <strong>OLEO</strong> and <strong>GRAN CRU</strong>, that bring the palette to a total of 13 shades</p>
